## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#Q1
data(rivers)
#T1
print(rivers)
#T2 method1
length(rivers)
mean(rivers)
median(rivers)
sd(rivers)
var(rivers)
min(rivers)
max(rivers)
#T2 method2
library(Hmisc)
describe(rivers)
#T3
rivers.Des.1 <- c(length(rivers),mean(rivers),median(rivers),sd(rivers),var(rivers),min(rivers),max(rivers));rivers.Des.1
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
